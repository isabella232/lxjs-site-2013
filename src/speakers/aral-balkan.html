						<p>Aral Balkan is an experience designer working to change the world by bringing design thinking to open source.</p>
						<p>His latest initiative, <a href="http://thelink.is/prometheus" title="Visit [Codename Prometheus]">[Codename Prometheus]</a>, is to design a new type of technology company; a design‐led company that makes open products.
						<p>Products that seamlessly combine hardware, software, and services to compete on user experience with the likes of Apple in the consumer space.</p>
						<p>Being open, they also have a very important added benefit in a post‐PRISM world: <em>you own your own data</em>.</p>
						<p>He recently won Voice of the Year at the Critter awards for his talks at international conferences. He sits on the board of Code Club.</p>
