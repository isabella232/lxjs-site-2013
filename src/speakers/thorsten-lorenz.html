						<p>Thorsten Lorenz has been creating nodejs projects for over two years mostly in his spare time. The main reason why he can't stop is, that ideas can be transformed into something that works in a very short amount of time when implemented in JavaScript.</p>
						<p>He believes that writing small modules instead of frameworks and managing them with npm is an important trend and created valuepack to make finding them a lot easier.</p>
						<p>Aside from his own projects, Thorsten contributes to projects he thinks to be important for the community. His most recent contribution is adding source map support to browserify.</p>
