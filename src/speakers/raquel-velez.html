						<p>Raquel Vélez received her BS in mechanical engineering from Caltech. She has been a practicing roboticist for 10 years, working at a variety of institutions including NASA JPL, the MIT Lincoln Laboratory, and various universities in Europe.</p>
						<p>She took a break to do that startup thing as a co-founder and CTO... but came to her senses and found a new life online as a software engineer.</p>
						<p>Raquel is now a front-end engineer at Storify in San Francisco, working with an amazing team of people to navigate and define the intersection between journalism and social media. In her off time, you can find her baking, hacking on node.js, and speaking. Also, hanging out with her hilarious husband and two cats dressed in dog suits.</p>
