						<p>Rod Vagg is a veteran Java warrior, who, having seen to the error of his ways, has moved on and developed an unhealthy obsession for Node.js.</p>
						<p>He works across the front and back-end, but prefers to tackle the difficult problems on the server. Most recently, Rod's found himself caught up in the chaotic community that's building "The Node Database" and is fascinated with the challenge of working out what on earth that might mean. He thoroughly enjoys acting as something of a steward of the core Node.js LevelDB libraries along with a growing team of very talented and inspiring developers.</p>
