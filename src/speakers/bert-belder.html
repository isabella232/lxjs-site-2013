						<p>Having been programming since he was a little kid, Bert got involved with open source when he started to port node.js to Windows. It got him the core contributor badge, and he hasn't left the project since. Earlier this year Bert founded his company StrongLoop together with long-term node maintainer Ben Noordhuis in an effort to lead node to world domination.</p>
