            <h3>Main Party (October 2nd)</h3>

            <p>Similarly to last year, and thanks to our sponsor <a href="https://www.spotify.com/pt/">Spotify</a>, we'll have a boat cocktail - Yay! The boat will leave <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Doca+Santo+Amaro+Armaz%C3%A9m+CP,+1350-353,+Alc%C3%A2ntara,+Lisboa,+Portugal+&hl=en&ie=UTF8&sll=38.735205,-9.13496&sspn=0.091858,0.181103&hq=Doca+Santo+Amaro+Armaz%C3%A9m+CP,&hnear=1350-353+Lisbon,+Portugal&t=m&z=16&iwloc=A">Alcantara docks</a> at around 19h (or as soon as we all get there) so that we try and get some of the sunset's views right from the tagus river. Don't worry, we'll have buses leaving the venue (Teatro de S. Jorge) at around 18:30 to take you there. <strong>Unfortunately, because the boat can only carry around 200 persons, we do ask you to <a href="https://tito.io/lxjs-2013/lxjs-2013?release_id=ioun-m-vs-e">pre-register</a>.</strong></p>

            <p>After the boat, at around 21h00 (9pm), we will, again, have a bus service taking you to the Venue (Teatro S. Jorge) in case you want to head home or your hotel with a stop on the way in the Rossio square to drop any of you that will want to continue the party on your own in Chiado / Bairro alto / Cais do Sodre - where a lot of the night life in Lisbon happens.</p>

            <h3>Farewell Party (October 3rd)</h3>

            <p>Our farewell party, sponsored by <a href="http://www.clubjudge.com/">clubjudge</a> will be at <a href="http://www.ministerium.pt/">Ministerium</a>. A club right in the center of Lisbon in <a href="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pra%C3%A7a_do_Com%C3%A9rcio">Praca do Comercio</a>. The party starts at around 20h00 (8pm).</p>

            <p>To get there, you can hop in the subway (at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=avenida+metro+lisboa&hl=en&ll=38.720106,-9.145818&spn=0.011485,0.022638&sll=38.720297,-9.146256&sspn=0.011485,0.022638&hnear=Avenida&t=m&z=16">Avenida metro station</a> right in front of the Venue) and ride it to <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=terreiro+do+paco+lisboa&hl=en&ie=UTF8&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=47.435825,92.724609&hnear=Terreiro+do+Pa%C3%A7o&t=m&z=16">Terreiro do paco</a> or you can just walk there and enjoy the main streets and squares of Lisbon. You can check the subway network <a href="http://www.metrolisboa.pt/informacao/planear-a-viagem/diagrama/">here</a>.</p>

            <p>We will have groups of people leaving the venue, on foot, starting from 19h30 (7:30pm), so you can just come with us.</p>

            <p>This is the club location in the map:</p>
