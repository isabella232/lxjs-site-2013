							<h2>Building a baby PaaS with Vagrant, Docker.io and Node.js</h2>

              <h3>Abstract</h3>

              <p>In this workshop you will build a baby PaaS from scratch. Starting with your development environment using Vagrant and ending with some Docker.io and Node.js magic.</p>
              <p>When you are building a project that needs development time and constant care across all stack, for example devops tools or PaaS related software, the complexity of your development environment will quickly increase.</p>
              <p>You will learn how to use Vagrant in order to leverage this task saving you precious time. Using this new development environment you will fiddle with Docker.io using Node.js while building a step­by­step basic PaaS using containers running on top of a Vagrant Virtual Machine. With your new ninja Docker skills, you will develop all container logic and control using Docker’s Remote API, implement container abstraction, scalable workers and balancer.</p>

              <h3>Profits</h3>

              <p>This workshop will be helping <a href="http://nodecopter.com/2013/lisbon/oct-4">Nodecopter LX</a> by donating it's profits so the organizers can make the event happen!</p>

							<h2>Appium: Get your hands on some Node-powered mobile automation!</h2>

              <h3>Abstract</h3>

              <p>In this workshop we will get practical with Appium. Participants will learn how to `npm install` and run the server, and how to write simple test cases for iOS and Android apps. We'll discuss Appium's test model, and how to access it using Wd.js (callbacks) or Yiewd (generators). We'll explore advanced mobile automation behaviors like swipes and finding elements by their hierarchy in the UI. Participants will walk away being able to automate their mobile apps in Javascript. It's about time automation came to mobile!</p>
