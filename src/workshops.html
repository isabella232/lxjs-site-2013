              <h3>Abstract</h3>

              <p>In this workshop you will build a baby PaaS from scratch. Starting with your development environment using Vagrant and ending with some Docker.io and Node.js magic.</p>
              <p>When you are building a project that needs development time and constant care across all stack, for example devops tools or PaaS related software, the complexity of your development environment will quickly increase.</p>
              <p>You will learn how to use Vagrant in order to leverage this task saving you precious time. Using this new development environment you will fiddle with Docker.io using Node.js while building a step­by­step basic PaaS using containers running on top of a Vagrant Virtual Machine. With your new ninja Docker skills, you will develop all container logic and control using Docker’s Remote API, implement container abstraction, scalable workers and balancer.</p>

              <h3>Profits</h3>

              <p>This workshop will be helping <a href="http://nodecopter.com/2013/lisbon/oct-4">Nodecopter LX</a> by donating it's profits so the organizers can make the event happen!</p>

              <h3>Abstract</h3>

              <p>In this workshop we will get practical with Appium. Participants will learn how to `npm install` and run the server, and how to write simple test cases for iOS and Android apps. We'll discuss Appium's test model, and how to access it using Wd.js (callbacks) or Yiewd (generators). We'll explore advanced mobile automation behaviors like swipes and finding elements by their hierarchy in the UI. Participants will walk away being able to automate their mobile apps in Javascript. It's about time automation came to mobile!</p>

              <h3>Abstract</h3>

              <p>Learn how to build large, complex, and native-like mobile apps using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. In this workshop you'll learn modern strategies and architectural patterns to build real-life Hybrid Applications that work and perform like native apps. You'll also learn how to efficiently use PhoneGap to leverage the native capabilities of your device in JavaScript and to package your HTML application as a native app for distribution through the different app stores.</p>

              <h3>Abstract</h3>

              <p>A hands-on on-boarding to Node.js focused on teaching you the essentials of how Node.js works thru code: Callback vs. Streams, How node core remains minimal with npm and user-land, What does Node core do for you (focused on network protocols). Finally we put it all together with a sample app and discuss performance implications of real-life Node.js production applications.</p>
